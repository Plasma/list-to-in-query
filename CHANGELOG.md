# Change Log

All notable changes to the "list-to-in-query" extension will be documented in this file.

### 1.3.1

Updated dependencies

### 1.3.0

Replaced previous option that allowed you to specify if items generated should appear on a new line or not, with two explicit commands. This provides more flexibility depending upon the number of items being formatted.

### 1.2.0

Added new configuration option so you can choose to perform indentation of items using spaces instead of tabs.

### 1.1.0

Added new configuration options so you can:

1) Keep generated IN Query (...) values on the same line (instead of separated on new lines)
2) Not quote numeric values in the IN Query (...)

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the extension.
